                          For computer users<br />
                          Who sit at a desk for hours at a time,<br />
                          <strong>LookAway</strong><br />
                          Is a web page that will play a designated audio clip, and display a prompt to follow the 20-20-20 rule.  Every 20 minutes, look at an object roughly 20 minutes away, for 20 seconds.<br />
                          Unlike relying on setting a manual reminder through an alarm program on your phone,<br />
                          Our product is web based, and can be used on any device that has a web browser.

                      <p>
                          For personal consumers<br />
                          Who are getting ready to shop or pay bills, but need to verify they have enough funds,<br />
                          <strong>BudgetCheck</strong><br />
                          Is a web page that you can enter your total budget amount, and then enter each individual amount you want to automatically subtract from that budget to make sure you will have enough funds.<br />
                          Unlike Microsoft Excel,<br />
                          Our product doesn't require the user to create complicated formulas or color formatting, as it is preprogrammed, and available on any device that has a web browser.

                      <p>
                          For parents<br />
                          Who have multiple children and need to set a schedule for children to take turns on a video game console or any device,<br />
                          <strong>WhoseTurnIsIt</strong><br />
                          Is a web based application that will allow the user to enter each child's name, and the amount of time they are allowed on a system.  The application will then create a queue, and alarm the parent when the next child's turn has arrived
                          Unlike using a home assistant such as google home,<br />
                          Our product will allow you to set the number of turns each child gets, and how long each individual child gets.
